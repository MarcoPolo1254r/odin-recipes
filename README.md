📘 HTML Recipe Website — Practice Project

This project is part of my HTML learning journey. The goal is to practice the fundamentals of structuring webpages using pure HTML.

🥣 Project Overview

In this activity, I built a basic recipe website using only HTML.
The project consists of:

A main index page listing multiple recipes

Individual recipe pages, each containing:

A title

An image

A list of ingredients

Step-by-step instructions

The website is intentionally simple and unstyled because the objective is to strengthen my HTML foundation. Later, I will return to this project to apply CSS and improve its design.

🎯 Skills Practiced

Creating HTML documents

Using headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images

Structuring content across multiple pages

Navigating between pages using relative paths
